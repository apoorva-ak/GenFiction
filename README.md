# Fiction Linguistic Analysis Project

## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze the linguistic differences between fiction written by humans and fiction generated by Language Model Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on flash fiction, encompassing stories ranging from 500 to 1000 words.

## Dataset
- A novel dataset has been created for this project.
- For human-written fiction, the Scrapy library was employed to scrape over 1000 stories from [Flash Fiction Online](https://www.flashfictiononline.com) and [Everyday Fiction](http://www.everydayfiction.com). This dataset is available in `real_fiction_data.csv` within the `datasets` folder, containing the following attributes:
  - `url`: URL from which data has been scraped
  - `title`: The title of the story
  - `author`: The name of the author
  - `content`: The content of the fiction story.
- For AI-written fiction, the dataset was manually created by providing writing prompts to ChatGPT. This dataset is present in `generated_fiction_data.csv` and includes 200 stories.
- To ensure dataset balance, 200 human-written stories and 200 AI-written stories were combined to form a final dataset containing 400 stories. This final dataset, along with the articles and the target label `isReal`, is present in `shuffled_data_new.csv`.
- The dataset, along with all extracted features, can be found in `data_with_all_features.csv`.

### Feature Extraction
- The features analyzed in this project broadly fall into three categories: Complexity features, Stylistic features, and Psychology features.
- For the extraction of both complexity and stylistic features, the Stanza library was utilized.
- The extraction of psychology features was accomplished using the Empath library.
- The scripts for feature extraction can be found in the `feature_extraction` folder.

## Modeling

- Two machine learning models were employed: Logistic regression and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Accuracies were computed for four different feature sets: Only complexity features, only stylistic features, only psychology features, and all features combined.
- The test-train split ratio is 30-70.
- SHAP, an xAI technique, was used for the global interpretation of both models on all the four feature sets.
- The code for the models and the xAI-based evaluation can be found in `models.ipynb` in the `model` folder.
